# m-skills — PostToolUse advisory: a skip marker just appeared in a test file.
#
# The narrowest defensible slice of the pack's four never-weaken rules
# (testing-architect 3, debugging-architect 4, security-architect 3,
# maintenance-architect 5). Those rules only bind while their skill is loaded;
# adding `.skip` is exactly the shortcut taken when it isn't.
#
# Detects NEWLY INTRODUCED skip markers only, by counting them in old_string vs
# new_string. Deliberately does NOT try to spot deleted assertions or loosened
# tolerances — that needs semantic diffing, and a noisy advisory is one the reader
# learns to scroll past.
#
# Advisory, never a block in the fatal sense: the runtime feeds the reason back and
# the turn continues, so Claude either justifies the skip or reverts it.
#
# Silent outside test files. Respects .m-skills-no-guards. Fails OPEN.

# m-skills — shared hook plumbing. Sourced, never executed.
#
# Hook scripts receive a JSON payload on stdin and answer on stdout. This file
# carries the three things all of them need: reading a field out of the payload,
# escaping a string back into JSON, and the emit helpers for each decision shape.
#
# Dependency note: the pack's "bash + coreutils only" contract holds for
# shell command out of JSON with sed is how a guard gets bypassed by a quoted
# newline. Every dev machine that runs Claude Code has one of the two.
#
# Engine missing splits by hook class, deliberately:
#   guards     → fail CLOSED (deny). An unverifiable guard that allows is the
#                A10 fail-open pattern code-review-architect flags.
#   advisories → fail OPEN (silent exit 0). A missed hint costs nothing.

emit_block "m-skills advisory — \`${FILE}\` gained a skip/only marker (${ADDED}).

Testing Architect constraint 3: never weaken a test to make it pass. Loosening a tolerance, deleting an assertion, adding a skip, or widening a mock to swallow the failure is a defect, not a fix — the same rule appears in debugging-architect 4, security-architect 3, and maintenance-architect 5.

If this is a deliberate, temporary quarantine: say so in one line, name what re-enables it, and keep it out of the \"gates green\" claim. If it is standing in for a fix, revert it and fix the cause instead. A \`.only\` in particular silently stops every other test in the file from running, which reads as green.

Advisory only — this hook cannot tell a legitimate quarantine from a shortcut."
